# WalkMyDog

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.5.

## Angular Standalone Component
- Standalone components explicitly manage their own dependencies. We can know with certainty what is
available in the template by expecting the component's list of imports.
- Simplified lazy-loading
